=head1 NAME

Test::System - Test suite oriented for testing system administration tasks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::System;

    my $suite = Test::System->new(
            format => 'consoletable',
            nodes => 'example.com',
            test_groups => '~/code/my/system/tests.yaml'
            );
    $suite->runtests;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Loads and runs a set of tests for verifying a system administration task
before a possible incident happens or after a task is executed.

Tests can be run as perl scripts and actually in any format L<TAP::Harness>
supports.

Some examples of how L<Test::System> can help you:

=over 4

=item *

Before a deployment probably you want to make sure your systems and
configuration files are ready to go. Also you probably want to make sure
that if you needed to apply patches to your configuration files, they
really got applied (even in a development server or verify directly on
production servers). So here L<Test::System> can help you verifying this
in the form of a test case. Of course, you write the test case :-)

=item *

What about if you have many servers and although you have nagios to verify
the speed of the CPU sometimes you need to verify it "on-demand" (perhaps when
you get new servers in your datacenter). Here L<Test::System> can help you to
verify that these servers are ready to go before even they get connected to nagios
or your favorite monitoring tool.

=back

One of the things you need to keep in mind is that L<Test::System> is B<NOT> a
monitoring system. It will let you verify things on demand, things that are
repetitive and perhaps you want them to be automated.

=head1 Attributes

The module offers a list of attributes, some of them are read-only.

=over 6

=item B<test_groups>

YAML filename that has a list of available tests. This is not required but
can be useful if you want to group tests (like I<hardware.yaml>, I<net.yaml>,
etc). Comes also handy when user does not provide a list of tests to execute,
so all the tests listed in this file are executed.

An example of a YAML file:

    ping:
        description: Test the ping and do foo and make bar
        code: test/foo.pl
    cpu:
        description: Test the CPU of nodes
        code: test/cpu.pl

=cut
has 'test_groups' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'Str',
        trigger => \&_read_test_groups_file
        );

=item B<available_tests>

Is a read only attribute that contains a list of all available tests found in
the YAML file provided by C<test_groups>.

=cut
has 'available_tests' => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
        );

=item B<nodes>

Is an attribute that can be represented as a string (like a hostname) or as a
list (where each item will be a node/hostname). This attribute has write access
and is where the tests are going to be executed to.

Another way of setting this value is when C<runtests()> is called, a test plan
(in the form of a YAML file) can be provided and it can contain the list of
nodes to use.

=cut
has 'nodes' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'Any',
        trigger => \&_verify_nodes_datatype
        );

=item B<format>

A write access string that has the format of how the tests should be presented,
please refer to the modules available under L<Test::System::Output> or in your
custom factory (C<format_factory_class> attribute) class if this is the case.

=cut
has 'format' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'Str',
        default => 'console',
        trigger => \&_verify_format
        );

=item B<available_formats>

A list of available formats, read only.

=cut
has 'available_formats' => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => => 'HashRef',
        default => \&_fill_available_formats_hash
        );

=item B<format_factory_class>

If you want to use your own Factory for creating your output you can set this
to your class name (B<NOT the object>).

=cut
has 'format_factory_class' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'Str',
        trigger => \&_fill_available_formats_hash
        );

=item B<harness>

Is (or will be) the harness instance once C<runtests> is executed.

=cut
has 'harness' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'TAP::Harness');

=item B<parameters>

An attribute with write access permission. This attribute will transform all
the items of this hash to environment variables.

The use of this attribute is very handy if you want to provide some additional
data for your tests and since the tests are run in separate forks with
L<Test::Harness> then the only possible way to keep them is to make them
available through the environment (C<%ENV> hash).

Please be warned that only scalars are stored in environment variables, those
that are an array will be converted to CSV values while the rest of the data
types will be lost.

In your tests if you want to use any of these parameters they will be available
through the environment variables with a prefix of: C<TEST_SYSTEM_> or you
can use L<Test::System::Helper> to get their values.

=cut
has 'parameters' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'HashRef[Str]',
        );


=item B<results>

A hash reference that contains the results of the tests. This information is
generated by the L<TAP::Parser::Aggregator>.

=over 4

=item * passed: Total of passed tests

=item * total: Total number of tests (passed or not)

=item * skipped: Total of skipped tests

=item * failed: Total of failed tests.

=back

=cut
has 'results' => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => 'HashRef[Str]',
        );

=item B<status>

A string (read-only) that contains a word that describes the status of all
the tests. This value is also generated by L<TAP::Parser::Aggregator>.

=cut
has 'status' => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => 'Str'
        );

=item B<show_warnings>

By default we show warnings of all things that can make your tests to run
in a different way than expected.

=back

=cut
has 'show_warnings' => (
        is => 'rw',
        isa => 'Bool',
        default => 1
        );

=head1 Methods

=head2 B<runtests(@tests,%options)>

It will run the given test cases (C<@tests>). The C<@tests> can be:

=over 4

=item * An array of test files to execute.

=item * Or, a string pointing to a test plan file (YAML).

=back

If no C<@tests> are given but we have a C<test_groups> then B<ALL> the tests
listed inside this file will be executed.

The C<%options> is a hash of options that will be passed to the L<TAP::Harness>
object, some useful parameters are:

=over 4

=item * verbosity

By default we mute everything with C<-9>.

=item * color

If you want the output (in console) to have color

=item * formatter

Although we use L<Test::System::Output::Factory> to offer a set of formatters
you can provide your own formatter object. See C<available_formats>.

=item * jobs

If you have many tests you probably want to increment this value (that defaults
to C<1>) so other tests can be run at the same time.

=head2 B<run_test_plan($test_plan, %options)>

It loads the given test plan file (should be written in YAML) in order to get
a list of tests to execute. Once it has a list of tests then it calls
C<runtests> with this list and with the C<%options>.

=cut
sub run_test_plan {
    my ($self, $test_plan, $options) = @_;

    if (@_ gt 2 and ref($options) ne 'HASH') {
        die "Options should be a hash reference";
    }

    my @tests_to_run = $self->get_tests_from_test_plan($test_plan);
    return $self->runtests(\@tests_to_run, $options);
}

=head2 B<setup_parser($parser)>

This method should B<never> be called directly since this is triggered by
L<TAP::Harness> when every L<TAP::Parser> object gets created.

This method is useful for setting the callbacks we want the parser to trigger.

C<$parser> should be a L<TAP::Parser> object.

=cut
sub setup_parser {
    my ($self, $parser) = @_;
    # We want to know what happens with every test.
    $parser->callback('ALL' => sub { $self->what_happened($parser, shift) });
}

=head2 B<pretests_verification(@tests, %options)>

Does some verification before the tests are executed. This method gets called
by C<runtests>.

The parameters it accepts are the same parameters passed to C<runtests> with
the main difference the tests are already filtered (eg, if a test plan in
YAML was provided we will use it or we will use all the tests listed inside
the C<test_groups>.

=cut
sub pretests_verification {
    my ($self, $tests, $options) = @_;
}


=head2 B<what_happened($parser, $result_test)>

Similar to I<setup_parser>, this should never be called since it will be
triggered by L<TAP::Parser> after each (sub)tests gets executed.

By default we check the reason of why the test failed so later we provide a
simple hash to parse with all the tests and the reasons of why they failed (if
this could be the case). And because we need to know what L<TAP::Parser>
instance we are processing we need to ask for it as a first parameter.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$parser> should be a L<TAP::Parser>

=item * C<$result_test> should be a L<TAP::Parser::Result::Test>.

=head2 B<set_results($aggregator)>

This is a callback and is only called/triggered by L<TAP::Harness> when all the
tests are done. It will fill the C<results> attribute with information of
everything.

Refer to the documentation of I<results> for more information.

The paramenter C<$aggregator> is a L<TAP::Parser::Aggregator>.

=head2 B<get_tests_from_test_plan($yaml_file,
        $do_not_fill_parameters, 
        $do_not_fill_nodes)>

Reads the given tests yaml file (C<$yaml_file>). This YAML file should have at
least a list of tests (in the form of a hash) and optionally can also have
parameters the tests should contain.

Although this method is used mostly internally there's the option to call it
as any other method I<Test::System> offers.

By default it will fill the parameters of your I<Test::System> instance but by
passing C<$do_not_fill_parameters> (second parameter) as true or something
that Perl understands as true then it will skip the part. This should be
presented as a hash in YAML syntax.

The above apply also to C<$do_not_fill_nodes> (third parameter). This should be
presented as an array in YAML syntax.

Once the file is read an array with all the tests will be returned.

An example of a YAML test plan file can be found inside the C<examples>
directory or:

    tests:
        - ping
        - cpu
        - memory
    parameters:
